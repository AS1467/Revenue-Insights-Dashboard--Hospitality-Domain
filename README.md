## Project Overview
This project is part of an imaginary scenario where AtliQ Grands, a prestigious chain of five-star hotels across India, is seeking to regain its market share and revenue in the luxury and business hotels category. The hospitality industry veteran, with over 20 years of experience, is facing challenges due to strategic moves by competitors and ineffective decision-making in management. To address these challenges, the managing director has decided to leverage "Business and Data Intelligence."

Due to the absence of an in-house data analytics team, AtliQ Grands has hired a 3rd party service provider to extract insights from their historical data. This project aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of AtliQ Grands' revenue management data and present it through an insightful dashboard.
